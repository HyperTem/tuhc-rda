# Rex Duodecim Angelus
Mod for the Unofficial Homestuck Collection that adds the fan animation, Rex Duodecim Angelus, to the comic at a location chosen in the settings.

By default, the animation is added after page 3763, right before entering Doc Scratch's apartment. This is the location recommended by the mod author.

Also included is the option to add the animation after page 2589, right when the fight is briefly shown in the normal comic. As the original mod was never updated with more options, I took the liberty of doing so myself. This option loses out on some context (notably the appearance of the ancestors as well as some visual callbacks), but also places the animation where it canonically takes place in the comic. It is up to you which location you prefer.<br /><br />

This fan animation was not in any way made by me. The animation itself contains credits for everyone who worked on it, even when viewed inside of the comic.

By default, you can find a link to the original video on the flash page (I've used previously unused page 2399), however this can be disabled in the settings.

You can also find a link [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-19Up0dLzNw). 

If you have any suggestions for alternate places to put the flash, please create an 'issue' on the original Github repository, not this fork of it. I only used my pedestrian knowledge of coding to piece together a second option for where the flash is placed. I don't actually know how to implement anything more complicated than editing what was already here, so I won't be adding anything more than this. Sorry! 

Also, let me know if I broke the original mod in some way without realizing it. If I did, then just go use the original, non-forked-by-me version.
